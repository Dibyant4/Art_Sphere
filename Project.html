    <p>ArtSphere is a concept project I designed and developed to create a space where artists, designers, and 
        creatives can showcase their work and connect with an audience. The goal was to design a clean, modern, and visually engaging website that 
        balances aesthetics with usability.  
    A visually clean and professional portfolio-style website that highlights art first.
Fully responsive design that works smoothly across devices.
A strong brand identity for ArtSphere that feels both modern and approachable.
Improved usability through consistent navigation and interaction patterns.</p>
